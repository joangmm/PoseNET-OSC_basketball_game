# PoseNET-OSC_basketball_game

Welcome to this github repository!

For the practica 3, I did a mini basketball game. Your objetive is to move yourself in order to put the orange ball in the orange basket, the green ball in the green basket, and the blue ball in the blue basket.

Every time you do one of this actions correctly, a message will be displayed!

Enjoy!!
